<h2>6.1 Introduction</h2><p>

In chapter 4 we saw how to construct a Scanner object to read input from the
Console.  Now we will see how to construct Scanner objects to read input from
files.  The idea is fairly straightforward, but Java does not make it easy to
read from input files.  This is unfortunate because many interesting problems
can be formulated as file processing tasks.  Many introductory computer science
classes have abandoned file processing altogether or the topic has moved into
the second course because it is considered too advanced for novices.<p>

There is nothing intrinsically complex about file processing.  The languages
C++ and C# provide mechanisms for easily reading and writing files.  But Java
was not designed for file processing and Sun has not been particularly eager to
provide a simple solution.  They did, however, introduce the Scanner class as a
way to simplify some of the details associated with reading files.  The result
is that file reading is still awkward in Java, but at least the level of detail
is manageable.<p>

Before we can write a file processing program, we have to explore some issues
related to Java exceptions.  Remember that exceptions are errors that halt the
execution of a program.  In the case of file processing, we might try to open a
file that doesn't exist, which would generate an exception.

<h2>6.2 Using a Scanner to Read an External File</h2><p>

An external file is a collection of characters and numbers that appear on one
or more lines.  They are external because they are not contained within the
program and are not obtained from the user during execution.  They are outside
the scope of the program and its execution.  You create external input files
before the execution of a program.  For example, you might create a file called
"numbers.dat" with the following content.<p>
